# Summary: Ten Simple Rules for Reading a Scientific Paper (Carey et al.)

## Overview
A guide for developing good habits when reading scientific literature, focusing on active reading strategies for both novice and experienced scientists.

## The 10 Rules

### Big Picture Recommendations (Rules 1-5)

**Rule 1: Pick Your Reading Goal**
- What you want from an article should influence how you read it
- Examples:
  - New to reading papers → Focus on each figure panel
  - Entering new field → Focus on motivation (intro) and next steps (conclusion)
  - Following an author → Skim and connect to their broader work
  - Tracking keywords/techniques → Focus on methods and motivation
  - Reviewing for publication/journal club → Evaluate if data supports interpretations

**Rule 2: Understand the Author's Goal**
- Both reader and writer influence the outcome
- Consider: Who are the authors? What field? How does this fit their research?
- Identify article type: methods, review, commentary, resource, or research article
- Article type guides your evaluation of the information

**Rule 3: Ask Six Questions**
For the complete work AND each figure/table/experiment:
1. What do the authors want to know? (motivation)
2. What did they do? (approach/methods)
3. Why was it done that way? (context within field)
4. What do the results show? (figures and data)
5. How did the authors interpret the results? (interpretation/discussion)
6. What should be done next? (your own thoughts)

**Rule 4: Unpack Each Figure and Table**
- Data is the most important part of research papers
- Two approaches: scrutinize figures first OR read results while examining figures sequentially
- For each figure: understand axes, color schemes, statistics, plotting approach
- For each table: identify experimental groups and variables
- Refer to methods frequently to understand how data were obtained
- Articulate the "take home" message for each

**Rule 5: Understand the Formatting Intentions**
Key sections and their purposes:
- **Title**: Take home message
- **Abstract**: Road map/elevator pitch
- **Introduction**: Research question and why it matters
- **Methods**: What and how (should enable recreation)
- **Results**: Objective observations of what was found
- **Discussion**: What results mean, author's perspective, next steps
- **Conclusion**: Summary of implications
- **References**: Important papers in the field
- **Supplemental**: Additional methods, results, raw data

### Philosophy of Reading (Rules 6-8)

**Rule 6: Be Critical**
- Published papers are NOT truths etched in stone (even in high-impact journals, by famous authors, or papers that agree with you)
- Science is never-ending work in progress
- Push back against interpretations to test conclusion strength
- Ask: Are there other equally likely explanations?
- Be aware of your own biases (confirmation bias, expectancy effects)
- Consider: Do I find this compelling because it affirms what I think? Or discount it because it differs from my expectations?

**Rule 7: Be Kind**
- Authors are human
- Give benefit of the doubt for minor issues (awkward phrasing, missing citations, typos)
- Don't let minor frustrations influence your evaluation
- When sharing critiques: be constructive, not mean-spirited
- Remember: authors invest years into a single paper

**Rule 8: Be Ready to Go the Extra Mile**
- Look up unfamiliar terms
- Dig into supplemental materials
- Read cited references
- Three-read approach:
  1. First read: just read without pressure
  2. Second read: aim to understand
  3. Third read: take notes
- Engage with the paper (print and annotate, highlight, circle, draw arrows)

### Integration (Rules 9-10)

**Rule 9: Talk About It**
- Teaching is one of the best ways to learn ("to teach is to learn twice")
- Discuss in journal clubs, lab meetings, classes
- Talk with peers, mentors, colleagues
- Use social media (Twitter) to discuss with scientists, public, or authors
- Describe at multiple levels: detailed, big picture, or implications for community
- Solidifies understanding and highlights knowledge gaps

**Rule 10: Build On It**
- Think of literature as Lego bricks building a wall
- Each brick = a published paper
- Your work adds the next brick on top
- Integrate knowledge from multiple sources
- Connect ideas across papers
- Implement techniques in your research
- Challenge or support hypotheses with literature review
- The structure becomes stronger and taller when building on others' work

## Key Takeaways
- Active reading is a learned skill requiring effort and practice
- Read with intent to understand
- An hour in the library saves a week at the bench
- Reading gets easier and faster with experience
- Foster good reading habits in yourself and others
