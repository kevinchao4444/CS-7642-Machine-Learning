# Summary: Ten Simple Rules for Structuring Papers (Kording & Mensh)

## Overview
A guide for writing scientific papers that focuses on how readers consume information to make papers more influential and the writing process more efficient.

## The 10 Rules

### Principles (Rules 1-4)
**Rule 1: One Central Contribution**
- Present only one main finding per paper
- Communicate it clearly in the title
- Readers should remember your main finding a year later

**Rule 2: Write for Naïve Readers**
- Write for flesh-and-blood humans who don't know your work
- You're the least qualified to judge your writing from a reader's perspective
- Use psychology principles (e.g., working memory constraints)

**Rule 3: Context-Content-Conclusion (CCC)**
- Beginning: sets up context
- Body: advances the story (content)
- End: provides conclusion
- Apply CCC at whole-paper, section, and paragraph scales

**Rule 4: Optimize Logical Flow**
- Avoid zig-zag: cover each subject in only one place
- Use parallelism: similar messages in similar form
- String related ideas together

### Components (Rules 5-8)
**Rule 5: Complete Story in Abstract**
- Context: the gap your paper fills (broad → narrow)
- Content: your novel method/approach and results
- Conclusion: how results answer the question + broader significance

**Rule 6: Introduction Shows Why It Matters**
- Progressively narrow paragraphs leading to the gap
- Each paragraph: context → knowns → unknown
- Last paragraph: compact summary of results that fill the gap

**Rule 7: Results as Logical Sequence**
- Build statements that support the central contribution
- Use declarative subsection headers
- First paragraph: overall approach and key methods
- Each paragraph: question → data/logic → answer
- Figures should tell the story independently

**Rule 8: Discussion Covers Gap, Limits, Relevance**
- First paragraph: summarize important findings
- Following paragraphs: strengths/weaknesses with literature links
- Final paragraphs: how the paper moves the field forward

### Process (Rules 9-10)
**Rule 9: Allocate Time Wisely**
- Prioritize: Title > Abstract > Figures > Outline
- Plan logical structure during experiments
- Create outline with one sentence per paragraph

**Rule 10: Get Feedback**
- Writing is optimization: improve story, outline, and sentences
- Don't get attached—rewriting is often faster than editing
- Use test readers to verify the story works
- Accept reviewer feedback positively

## Key Takeaways
- Clear communication is crucial for scientific progress
- Structure papers for reader experience, not chronological research process
- The title is read most, so invest time accordingly
- Good abstracts take many iterations
- Build a network of colleagues for manuscript feedback
